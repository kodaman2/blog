title: Showcase Generatrix Utility for Git Branches/Tags Markdown
---

I wrote this utility last week which I call [Generatrix](https://github.com/kodaman2/generatrix_py). It generates markdown for a repo branches/tags. I don't know how much of a problem this is for other people, but I figured to share it anyways. If you are doing a tutorial, and need to provide code to your users, and you split the code in branches or tags as you progress throughout the tutorial or lesson, you can too use generatrix.

## Backstory

I actually started doing a static site on [https://kodaman2.github.io/generatrix/](https://kodaman2.github.io/generatrix/), [repository](https://github.com/kodaman2/generatrix) but I sorta failed miserably because I suck at JScript, well not really, I just suck at async code. I got frustated, and I did asked for help which some folks provided awesome help and I still have to work on it. Site works but branches are spit out not in date order, sometimes.
